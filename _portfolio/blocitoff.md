## Explanation
Translating my code from Javascript to Jquery was a much needed experience. My understanding JavaScript was not completely there so understanding a tool based off of JavaScript was daunting to say the least.


## Problem

The problem was that it wasn't apparent to me that my JavaScript was flaky, but once I dove into JQuery it became obvious that my JavaScript understanding needed some help. 

## Solution

This made me go back to the drawing board and made sure that my foundation on JavaScript was solid. I went back and made sure I knew and comprehended my basics on JavaScript. I reviewed everything from functions to objects, and then made sure I knew how to translate that into JQuery. 

## Results

I understood that JavaScript and JQuery can work hand in hand. Combining some aspects of each in order to avoid over convoluted or over simplistic code. As a result, I was able to rewrite my JavaScrpt code as JQuery. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I learned that it is nearly impossible to understand a language without its basic principles and rules. Tools such as JQuery are great help used in the correct manner.
