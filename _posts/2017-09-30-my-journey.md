My journey coding has been a true odyssey.
 It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. I’ve definitely experienced everything from anger to the whole spectrum of emotions. Angry, when I’m stuck because there’s is something wrong with my code. Ecstatic, when I finally solved a problem that seemed unsolvable. 

 I’ve become mortal enemies with my computer at one point and best friends the next. Sometimes. I  don’t know whether to hug my computer or throw it out the window. I’ve literally talked to my computer to see if it would tell me what is wrong as if i were some kind of computer whisperer, yet to no avail. I’ve experience the good and the bad. I would have to say more bad experiences than good. But, in the midst of all this I have experienced these situation which in return have made me a better developer. 
It is only when you go through all the bad that it makes the good experiences taste so good. There’s no better satisfactory sensation than getting unstuck from a problem that has befuddled your mind extended periods of time. I guess it’s like saying, “You take the good with the bad”.
