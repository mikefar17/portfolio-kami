title: Goals as a Developer
---

I think my main goal as front-end developer would be to create a fun interactive aestetically pleasing web page or app that is really user friendly. 
I mean we all know that it is the inside that counts, but hey, that doesn’t mean that the exterior should be hard to look at. 
I would like for a user to look at something I created and be compelled to use it over and over again. Well, isn’t that every web developer’s dream? 
I really like front end web development and if anything I would like it to be a big part of what my overall focus in web development. However, there are a lot of technologies out there and I would like to experience some of these in order to make my final decision. 

But, I think the real challenge that comes from front-end web development is making something beautiful and of course that meets all the requirements needed or expected. Yes, definitely meeting the requirement is important. I mean there’s no use in creating something masterful if it is complete opposite of what the parameter or indications instructed. So, I think finding the balance between vanity and functionality would be an important aspect of web development in my personal journey.
