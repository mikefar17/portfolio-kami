title: Biggest Challenge
---

My biggest challenge in web development is starring down my computer. When there is a problem with my code I tend stare at my computer and over think. There is a “stare off” between my computer and I as we were mortal enemies. 
Gift is possible 
Instead of taking a step back and look at possible solutions, I get tunnel vision. I have lost much time that way. 
I’m currently working on this problem. Approaches I have taken include taking a small pauses and . When the work loads gets too overwhelming I try to a step back and clear my head. 
I also try not to take it too personally. Event though I would love to get my code right the first time, the odds of that happening.
 I have the tendency to make little syntax errors which cost me dearly but I’ve learned to take my time and to be patient with myself. As I first started learning to code, I began with the idea that I will learn everything fast and keep going without stopping so I could become a coding software machine. In essence, I was that new guy at the gym that thinks he can lift heavy and that he will get ripped abs the next day even though that was first day. Yes, I was that guy when it came to writing code. So, I kept making amateur mistakes like syntax errors in my journey to speed my way through coding which had the opposite of the result desired. 
In the end, I learned that there is no speeding through the basics and that like many things in life, coding takes time and practice to truly become skilled in this area.
